  <p><strong> Version 6 - <a href="http://https://github.com/AngelGryph/MadeInHeaven_ItemPack/releases">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br />
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod introduces several new items in the original saga, Siege of Dragonspear, Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal.  A few item-oriented tweaks are also included.  This is part one of the "Made in Heaven" mod bundle which also contains a spell pack and a quest pack.</p>
  <p>In the original saga, a new merchant is added to the Friendly Arm Inn, you can find him in the normally unoccupied house to the left of the inn.  He may not immediately want to sell to you, but try again after you made a bit of a name for yourself and you may find him more forthcoming.  Several items can also be found in a few other places.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with most other WeiDU mods.  The core item pack should be compatible with all other mods, no conflicts are known at this time.  The bundled item tweaks may be incompatible with mods that have similar tweaks, like Item Revisions.  As an item pack, this mod should be installed fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.  The included tweaks should preferably be installed after other item mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br />
  If you have an older version of the MiH Item Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br />
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br />
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must either run a 'modmerge' or install 'A7-DlcMerger' before installing this mod (or any WeiDU-based mods, really).  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br />
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder and setup-mih_ip.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_ip.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_ip.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_ip.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder, setup-mih_ip, and setup-mih_ip.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_ip.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a directory that is in your $PATH (commonly /usr/local/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_ip.debug mih_ip/setup-mih_ip.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Item Pack are already all lower case, there is no need to run tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br />
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod may have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>

  <h3>Core Component</h3>
  <p><strong>MiH Item Pack</strong><br />
  The main component of this mod, the item pack will add over a hundred new items, divided all over BG1 and BG2, including Siege of Dragonspear (EE) and Throne of Bhaal.  A handful of these items were ported from Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment, all others are original creations, based on various D&amp;D source books and other media.</p>
  <p>In BG1 two merchants are available.  The first, the dwarven smith Brokk, will be found at the Friendly Arm Inn, he is in the normally unoccupied house just west of the main building.  He may not want to sell to you right away, but remember to visit him later!  Brokk may also offer to make a new item for you if you bring him something unusual, so check back with him now and then.</p>
  <p>The second new merchant is found in the armorer's tent at the Nashkel fair.  A young girl named Phendra will be selling low-level spell scrolls to fund her uncle's arcane research.  And if you find something inherently magical, she might be able to help both her uncle and you in some other way...</p>

  <h3>Item Functionality Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>BG1-style Wands in BG2</strong><br />
  <p>This alters wands in BG2 and games based on it like BGT to work like they did in BG1; the Wand of Frost is a single beam of frost, and the Wand of Lightning projects one 6d6 lightning bolt per use.</p>

  <p><strong>Alternative Healing Potions</strong><br />
  This modification will change the way healing potions work.  You can choose between Pen &amp; Paper rules, Icewind Dale Rules or Baldur's Gate 2 rules.  That last one will obviously not change anything on BG2, but will effect any games that include Icewind Dale.  The P&amp;P option tends to make the game slightly harder as healing is more random and less reliable.  The Icewind Dale option tends to make the late game harder as well.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th /><th>Pen &amp; Paper</th><th>Icewind Dale</th><th>Baldur's Gate 2</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Healing</td><td>2d4+2 (4-10)</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Extra Healing</td><td>3d8+3 (6-27)</td><td>18</td><td>27</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Superior Healing</td><td>6d8+2 (8-50)</td><td>27</td><td>40</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Change item Type of Holy Symbols</strong></p>
  <p>This small tweak changes the item type of the holy symbols received by high-level clerics.  Normally they are rings, with this tweak you can turn them into either amulets (makes the most sense IMHO) or belts (what was originally planned, judging by the file name of the items).  This tweak covers the symbols in the vanilla game, those introduced by the Fixpack/EE (Aerie's and Viconia's), and Yeslick's if the Yeslick NPC mod is installed.  If any others should be covered, let me know!</p>

  <p><strong>Turn generic Full Plate into Field Plate</strong></p>
  <p>Full plate mail is a rare and precious item normally custom-made for the wearer and not usable by anyone else, so you should not be able to just walk into a shop and buy some off of the shelf.  This tweak turns all generic full plate into the slightly less powerful field plate.  All named- or otherwise special armors are unchanged, including the suit created by Limited Wish.  (Specifically, the items affected are plat04, plat14 and plat23.)</p>
  <p>This modification probably has the biggest effect on Baldur's Gate 1, where full plate is normally the best armor available.  It will now be less powerful (especially versus slashing and piercing/missiles), making the various enchanted armors you find a more interesting alternative.  With the abundance of magical armors available in Baldur's Gate 2 it will probably not make much of a difference, except maybe when you have just left Chateau Irenicus.</p>
  <table>
  <tr><th></th><th>base AC</th><th>AC vs. slashing</th><th>AC vs. piercing and missile</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Field Plate</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td><tr>
  <tr><td>Full Plate</td><td>1</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><tr>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Turn all Dragon Scale Armor into Scale Mail</strong></p>
  <p>Dragon scale armor in the game is a bit all over the place.  Some are considered to be leather armor, some are plate mail, some are in between somewhere.  This tweak converts all dragon scale armor in the game to scale mail (+1 vs. piercing/missile) that weighs 25 pounds and has the following penalty on thieving skills: Open Locks -10%, Find Traps -10%, Pick Pockets -25%, Move Silently -15%.  This means that all dragon scale armors can be used by all classes except single-class mages and monks, and the kits shapeshifter- and avenger druid and kensai.  Base armor class and all abilities are unchanged.  Although technically not made from a dragon, this component alters the Ashen Scales too.</p>

  <p><strong>Miscellaneous Item Improvements</strong><br />
  This is a collection of small tweaks that makes a couple of items more powerful, less overpowered, or less of a hassle to use.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gloves of Dexterity: Made a closer match to its P&amp;P version: +4 Dex, +10 pick pockets, +10 open locks.</li>
    <li>Cloak of the Wolf: The wolf polymorphed into is now a winter wolf.  The cloak now also gives infravision and some cold resistance.</li>
    <li>Cloak of Balduran: Magic resistance reduced from 25% to 10%, but in exchange it is now available in chapter 6 of BG2 (from Ribald's special shop).</li>
    <li>Cloak of the Shield: It no longer uses charges, effects are permanent while worn.</li>
    <li>Potion of Invulnerability: Now works as per P&amp;P: +2 AC, +2 saves, immunity to normal weapons for one turn.</li>
    <li>Elixer of Health: This potion will now also cure blindness and deafness in addition to poison and disease.</li>
    <li>Skull of Death: It now regenerates 1 HP/turn and casts the following spells once per day: Animate Dead, Finger of Death and Control Undead.</li>
    <li>Shadow Dragon Scale: This armor now grants immunity to level drain instead of acid resistance.</li>
    <li>Helm of the Rock: This item can now be worn by paladin and rangers.</li>
    <li>Bard's Gloves: This item can now be worn by thief/mages and fighter/thief/mages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>TODO: </strong>This tweak currently does not update item descriptions.</p>

  <h3>Item Availability Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Add Potions of Extra Healing in BG1</strong><br />
  <p>This makes a limited quantity of Potions of Extra Healing available in Baldur's Gate 1.  Look for them in major temples and dedicated potion shops.  Also the large stacks of Potions of Healing in Durlag's Tower are replaced by equivalent amounts of Potions of Extra Healing (roughly 3:1).</p>

  <p><strong>Nerf BG1 Easter Egg Items</strong></p>
  <p>This replaces some of the easter egg items in hidden containers in Baldur's Gate 1 by valuable but non-magical items.  These are the Ring of Wizardry at the Friendly Arm Inn, the Ring of Protection +1 at the crossroads, the Ankheg Plate +2 in Nashkel and the Ring of Fire Resistance in the Gibberling Mountains.</p>

  <p><strong>Sensible Item Shops</strong></p>
  <p>A number of shops in Baldur's Gate 1 and (to a lesser degree) Baldur's Gate 2 sell items that seem unlogical, most glaringly the stacks of magical large shields in various shops in BG1.  A number of other items is strangely obscure, like the Longbow +1 and Splint Mail +1.  This components edits a number of shops to make item availability a bit more logical.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Large Shield +1: Removed from most shops that have them, one each added to the Thunderhammer Smithy and Feldepost's Inn.</li>
  <li>Shadow Thief Armor +3: Moved from Thunderhammer Smithy to Black Lily's store in Baldur's Gate.</li>
  <li>Dagger of Venom +2: Moved from Thunderhammer Smithy to Black Lily's store in Baldur's Gate.</li>
  <li>Warhammer +1: One added to Thunderhammer Smithy.</li>
  <li>Splint Mail +1: One added to Thunderhammer Smithy.</li>
  <li>Spear +1: One added to Thunderhammer Smithy.</li>
  <li>Longbow +1: One added to Feldepost's Inn.</li>
  <li>Aishideena +2: Moved from Lower Reaches to Adventurer's Market.</li>
  <li>Borok's Fist +2: Moved from Adventurer's Market to Lower Reaches.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>The .ini File</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called mih_ip.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option, for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components whose settings you changed.</p>
