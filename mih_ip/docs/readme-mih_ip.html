  <p><strong> Version 3 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#mih_ip">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br />
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod introduces several new items in the original saga, Siege of Dragonspear, Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal.  A few item-oriented tweaks are also included.  This is part one of the "Made in Heaven" mod bundle which also contains a spell pack and a quest pack.</p>
  <p>In the original saga, a new merchant is added to the Friendly Arm Inn, you can find him in the normally unoccupied house to the left of the inn.  He may not immediately want to sell to you, but try again after you made a bit of a name for yourself and you may find him more forthcoming.  Several items can also be found in a few other places.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install the item pack fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br />
  If you have an older version of the MiH Item Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br />
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br />
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must run a program called 'modmerge' before installing any WeiDU mods like this one.  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br />
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder and setup-mih_ip.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_ip.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_ip.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_ip.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder, setup-mih_ip, and setup-mih_ip.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_ip.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_ip.debug mih_ip/setup-mih_ip.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Item Pack are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br />
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <p><strong>MiH Item Pack</strong><br />
  The main component of this mod, the item pack will add over a hundred new items, divided all over BG1 and BG2, including Siege of Dragonspear (EE) and Throne of Bhaal.  A handful of these items were ported from Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment, all others are original creations, based on various D&amp;D source books and other media.</p>
  <p>In BG1 a two merchants are available.  The first, the dwarven smith Brokk, will be found at the Friendly Arm Inn, he is in the normally unoccupied house just west of the main building.  He may not want to sell to you right away, but remember to visit him later!  Brokk may also offer to make a new item for you if you bring him something unusual, so check back with him now and then.</p>
  <p>The second new merchant is found in the armorer's tent at the Nashkel fair.  A young girl named Phendra will be selling low-level spell scrolls to fund her uncle's arcane research.  And if you find something inherently magical, she might be able to help both her uncle and you in some other way...</p>
  <p><strong>BG2 Items in BG1</strong><br />
  <p>This adds a few select items from BG2, that are generally a bit too weak for that game, into BG1 where they are much more useful and fun.  You'll find them here and there in shops and containers, and on defeated enemies.  If there is a BG2 item you think should be in BG1, let me know!  If you can convince me it should be in BG1, I will make it so!</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Cloak of the Wolf</strong><br />
  The Cloak of the Wolf: Reiltar's Mistake is pretty weak and useless.  Turning into a wolf has very few real advantages and can't be used for stealth as enemies will attack anyway.  Noticing that this item was rather similar to the Cloak of the Bat from the DMG which also gives an AC bonus of 2, I decided to give the Cloak of the Wolf an AC bonus of 1, making it a little more useful.</p>
  <p><strong>Nerfed Cloak of Balduran</strong><br />
  Let's face it, the 25% magic resistance from this cloak is pretty overpowered, so much in fact that the developers decided not to bring this item back in BG2 and not even UB will restore it.  This modification will reduce it to a more modest but still useful 10%.  If installed on a BG2 game, the cloak will be available from the Adventurer's Market in chapter 6.</p>
  <p><strong>Alternative Healing Potions</strong><br />
  This modification will change the way healing potions work.  You can choose between Pen &amp; Paper rules, Icewind Dale Rules or Baldur's Gate 2 rules.  That last one will obviously not change anything on BG2, but will effect any games that include Icewind Dale.  The P&amp;P option tends to make the game slightly harder as healing is more random and less reliable.  The Icewind Dale option tends to make the late game harder as well.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th /><th>Pen &amp; Paper</th><th>Icewind Dale</th><th>Baldur's Gate 2</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Healing</td><td>2d4+2 (4-10)</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Extra Healing</td><td>3d8+3 (6-27)</td><td>18</td><td>27</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Potion of Superior Healing</td><td>6d8+2 (8-50)</td><td>27</td><td>40</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>P&amp;P Potion of Invulnerability</strong><br />
  This alters the Potion of Invulnerability to work by the book: It grants only a +2 bonus to AC and saves but also makes the imbiber immune to non-magical weapons.  This makes them very valuable in many fights in BG1 where not that many opponents have magical weapons.</p>
  <p><strong>Elixers of Health cure blindness/deafness</strong><br />
  As the title says, this changes Elixers of Health to also remove blindness and deafness.  I always thought it pretty strange that they didn't.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Skull of Death</strong><br />
  This alters the Skull of Death to be closer to the version described in the Encyclopedia Magica.  It now gives the wearer mild regeneration, and casts the following three spells once a day: Animate Dead, Finger of Death and Control Undead.<br/>
  Note: This component overwrites the item, previous changes are lost.</p>
</div>
<h2>The .ini File</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called setup-mih.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option, for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components whose settings you changed.</p>
