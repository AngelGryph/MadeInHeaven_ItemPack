@0 = ~Cloak of the Wolf: Relair's Mistake 
A great amount of irony surrounds the creation of this magical cloak. Relair was a mage who overestimated the amount of control he had over magic, and in the course of creating this garment, he apparently inflicted lycanthropy upon himself. The wearer can change form whenever <PRO_HESHE> wishes. Relair was not so lucky.
