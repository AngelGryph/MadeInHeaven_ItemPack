Thom wore the girdle proudly until he fell into severe debt in his later years. To his undying regret, he auctioned it off to a well-known priest of Mask.

An enchanter of items, he was well known for his discriminating taste in clothing, jewelry, and other accessories. His polished silver bracers were a constant part of his wardrobe.

Beldan employed the helm frequently, as Iraeni was often attacked by agents of Myrkul. After twenty years of serving Lathander, Iraeni decided to step down from her office, as did Beldan. They were married shortly after. Beldan gave the helm to an errant paladin of Lathander, who is believed to have died fighting a lich near the Battle of the Bones.

@12   = ~Three White Doves +3~
@13   = ~An extremely unusual mace, Three White Doves was created by an Ilmaterian priest named Alledec in 850 DR.  Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away.  This ivory-headed mace was the result.  The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory.  Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place.  The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace.  It is carved from pure ivory and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon.  The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace.  It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater.  The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold.  Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest.  Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

During the time of cooperation between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn's Deep, many wondrous items were produced. This suit of armor was one of them. Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by the evil elf Maiden Ilmadia, who wore it in her final battle against the Defenders of Easthaven at Lower Dorn's Deep. What happened to the armor after her defeat and how it traveled from the Spine of the World to the Sword Coast is unclear.

When Bil disappeared from the realms over a century ago, his ring was one of many items he left behind to his friends and associates. Because many of his friends and associates were larcenous thugs, it is assumed that the ring was sold to the highest bidder as soon as possible.

Nesk took the robes as a prize. They were later stolen and sold by a daring rogue.

Amaunator was the god of law and the god of the sun. He required his servants to follow his edicts exactly. Kalamnin did his best to observe Amaunator's laws in his travels. The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons. The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

@38   = ~Pale Justice +4~
@39   = ~This sword was made with one purpose: to destroy evil. Though a powerful weapon, Pale Justice has humble beginnings. The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold. Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade. As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr. The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar. He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power. The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it. After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence. Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr. Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade. It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.

The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses. Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time. He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago.

The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword. The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls. Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso. The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke. "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods. Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison."

Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon. The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon. He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.

"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power. I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility. Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant. It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."

Edan took the blade to a local weaponsmith and had him put a wooden, leather-wrapped grip on it. He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

The head itself is egg-shaped and made of red-stained cherry wood reinforced by decorative arcing bronze bands. Steel flanges stick out from the head in an asymmetrical pattern. The two largest flanges bear extensive etching. One is a classical image of Tymora with the word "WEAL" in Thorass. The other is an image of Beshaba with the word "WOE." Despite the delicate materials used in the mace's construction, it is exceptionally sturdy. The history of the mace is largely a mystery.
