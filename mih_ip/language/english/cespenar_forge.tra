@0  = ~Ooh, black dragon scales!  So sour, make nice vinegar you know.  But Cespenar thinks, you much more interested in making armor than cooking, yes?  5000 gold and Cespenar will make stylish black armor for you!~
@1  = ~Okay, you loss.  Cespenar will just let black scales stink up your backpack some more.~
@2  = ~Mm, these are green dragon scales!  Very stinky, green dragons belch worse than they fart!  Heh.  Cespenar has recipe though.  Just 5000 gold and Cespenar can make shiny green armor for you!  Won't even stink as bad, probably.~
@3  = ~Okay then, if great one wants stinky scales fouling up <PRO_HISHER> backback, who is Cespernar to tell <PRO_HISHER> no?~
