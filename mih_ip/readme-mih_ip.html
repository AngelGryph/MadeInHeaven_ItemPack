  <p><strong> Version 2 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#mih_ip">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br />
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod introduces several new items in the original saga, Siege of Dragonspear, Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal.  A few item-oriented tweaks are also included.  This is part one of the "Made in Heaven" mod bundle which also contains a spell pack and a quest pack.</p>
  <p>In the original saga, a new merchant is added to the Friendly Arm Inn, you can find him in the normally unoccupied house to the left of the inn.  He may not immediately want to sell to you, but try again after you made a bit of a name for yourself and you may find him more forthcoming.  Several items can also be found in a few other places.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install the item pack fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.  However, if you want the item tweaks (especially Cap Item Charges and Relative Stat Bonuses) to work on items introduced by other mods, you should install MiH Item Pack after such mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br />
  <p>If you have an older version of the MiH Item Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p>If you have a version of BGEE with Siege of Dragonspear obtained from Steam or GoG, you need to run a program called 'modmerge' before installing any WeiDU mods.  This is not needed if you obtained your copy from Beamdog.</p>
  <p>If you are installing on the older non-EE games (BG2 or BGT) you must install both Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher for this mod to work correctly.  Some parts of this mod will not work properly or at all without them.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder and setup-mih_ip.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_ip.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_ip.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_ip.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    Made in Heaven: Item Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_ip folder, setup-mih_ip, and setup-mih_ip.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_ip.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation director and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_ip.debug mih_ip/setup-mih_ip.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Item Pack are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
