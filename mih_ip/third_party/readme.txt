All the code in this directory was written by other people and shamelessly
stolen- I mean, copied with thanks by me.  I did no editing on this at all
other than a bug fix or two which I reported back to the original authors.

Currently included here are:


From Sword Coast Stratagems v35.21, updated July 24th 2025:

                  Implemented scroll table hotfix.


My sincere thanks to my fellow modders for all their help and hard work.
